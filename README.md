Given array of integers, 

Find the maximal possible sum with integer k for each array element.

**Example**

For a = [2, 3, 5, 1, 6] and k = 2, 

   the output should be: 
   solve(a, k) = 8

All possible sums of 2 consecutive elements are:
-   2 + 3 = 5;
-   3 + 5 = 8;
-   5 + 1 = 6;
-   1 + 6 = 7.

   Thus, the answer is 8
